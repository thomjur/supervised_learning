    "One relatively simple option is to publish the projects on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/). Medium.com is a popular blogging platform that allows for easy publication of posts on various topics. It is particularly interesting because it has a large community and offers a wide range of tutorials and articles, especially in the areas of technology, IT, data science, and AI. This means that your posts have the potential to reach a large and engaged readership.\n",
    "\n",
    "To publish your posts on Medium.com, you will need to manually insert them there, but the process is straightforward. Code inclusion can be done using [GitHub gists](https://gist.github.com/), which allow you to share code snippets.\n",

    "Here's how you can do it (basic knowledge of git is assumed):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a repository either locally or on GitHub.\n",
    "2. Clone the repository (if you created it on GitHub).\n",
    "3. Create the notebook in the repository or add it to the repository.\n",
    "4. Install `nbconvert` (via `pip install nbconvert`).\n",
    "5. Convert the Jupyter Notebook to an HTML file by running the following command: `jupyter nbconvert --to html --output index.html notebook.ipynb` (where `notebook.ipynb` is the notebook you want to convert).\n",
    "6. Add and commit all files as usual using `git add .` and `git commit -m \"message\"`, then push the changes to your repository.\n",
    "7. Next, go to your repository on GitHub and navigate to the \"Settings\" tab. Look for the \"Pages\" section (see the screenshot below). Choose the appropriate branch (most likely `main` or `master` unless you have made changes) and click on \"Save\".\n",
    "8. Now, your Jupyter Notebook is available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>` (for example, [Link supervised learning notebook.](https://thomjur.github.io/supervised_learning/)).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. You can convert the Jupyter Notebook into an HTML slideshow and then start it. The command for this is as follows: `jupyter nbconvert --to slides --output presentation notebook.ipynb`. You can then start the presentation in your browser by opening the generated HTML file.\n",
    "2. If you install the RISE extension, you can also start the presentation directly within the notebook. To install and activate RISE, use the following commands: `pip install rise`, `jupyter-nbextension install rise --py --sys-prefix`, and `jupyter-nbextension enable rise --py --sys-prefix`.\n",

    "[ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a powerful way to make your notebooks interactive and implement a graphical user interface (GUI) that simplifies access to your analysis or program for other people. However, it can also be useful to set up GUI elements for better usability during your own analyses. You can install ipywidgets as usual using `pip install ipywidgets`.\n",
